      carddescription: Front-end web development, also known as client-side
        development is the practice of producing HTML, CSS and JavaScript for a
        website or Web Application so that a user can see and interact with them
        directly. The challenge associated with front end development is that
        the tools and techniques used to create the front end of a website
        change constantly and so the developer needs to constantly be aware of
        how the field is developing.

      carddescription:
        The objective of designing a site is to ensure that when the
        users open up the site they see the information in a format that is easy
        to read and relevant. This is further complicated by the fact that users
        now use a large variety of devices with varying screen sizes and
        resolutions thus forcing the designer to take into consideration these
        aspects when designing the site. They need to ensure that their site
        comes up correctly in different browsers (cross-browser), different
        operating systems (cross-platform) and different devices (cross-device),
        which requires careful planning on the side of the developer.

    - cardheading: Native from Web Tech
      carddescription:
        Eventually, what is learned from web browser development can be
        used by front-end developers to craft code for environments that are not
        fueled by a browser engine. As of late, development environments are
        being dreamed up that use web technologies (e.g., CSS and JavaScript),
        without web engines, to create native applications.
